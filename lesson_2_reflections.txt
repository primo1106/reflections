Reflections - Lesson 2

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    A .git folder is created and it stores all the metadata for future changes in my files and I need to do this because that was it will be easier to fix errors or bugs in the future.
    
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
    The staging area is where the files I want to commit are held. Only the files in the staging area will save a version of their current state when commited. The working directory shows all my files in the current directory, regardless of the files being added to the staging area or not. The repository is the area where git can operate.
