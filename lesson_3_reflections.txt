Reflections - Lesson 3

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    When you want to share it with other people, or working as a collaboration.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    Because some of the files in GitHub might be old versions or versions from other contributors that I dont need.
    
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
    Forks are a clone from a GitHub repository to another so a new user can modify the contents of said repository, a clone is a copy of a repository hosted in GitHub or one contained locally, and a branch is a new line of commits that introduce new changes to the project in the repository.
    
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
    That I can check the version I have in GitHub without having to pull it.
    
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
    I would send versions of my file to my collaborators, and they will have to see the changes manually, its time consuming and also there is more room for critical errors.
    
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
    I would create a new branch when I want to introduce a new feature into my project so it stays as a different set of logics.
