Reflections - Lesson 3

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    When you want to share it with other people, or working as a collaboration.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    Because some of the files in GitHub might be old versions or versions from other contributors that I dont need.
