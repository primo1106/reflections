Reflections - Lesson 3

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    When you want to share it with other people, or working as a collaboration.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    Because some of the files in GitHub might be old versions or versions from other contributors that I dont need.
    
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
    Forks are a clone from a GitHub repository to another so a new user can modify the contents of said repository, a clone is a copy of a repository hosted in GitHub or one contained locally, and a branch is a new line of commits that introduce new changes to the project in the repository.
